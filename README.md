# MultiXscale, a EuroHPC Centre of Excellence

<p align="center"><img src="img/multixscale_logo.png" alt="MultiXscale logo" width="500px"/></p>

MultiXscale, a EuroHPC Centre of Excellence (CoE), is a new large-scale international project funded by the European Commission and the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking. It will extend the applications, user-base and domains actively engaged in the current CoE and EuroHPC ecosystem by addressing specific and critical needs, and advancing the transition towards use of exascale resources by scientific and industrial users in the community of multiscale modelling. This 4-year research project started on the 1st January 2023 and comprises a consortium of 15 partners, including European world-renowned research institutions and companies.

The technical aspect of MultiXscale will help mature the European Environment for Scientific Software Installations (EESSI). [EESSI](https://eessi.github.io/docs/) is a collaboration between different HPC sites and industry partners, with the common goal to set up a shared repository of optimized scientific software installations that can be seamlessly used (and transparently updated) on a variety of computer systems, regardless of which flavor/version of Linux distribution or processor architecture is used, or whether it is a full-size HPC cluster, a cloud environment, a personal workstation, or even a Raspberry Pi. EESSI will support the scientific drivers of MultiXscale, enabling CI/CD best practices and distributing the software used and developed within the project across all EuroHPC systems (and beyond). EESSI uses a number of open source to provide its services: CernVM-FS for distribution, Gentoo Prefix for OS-compatibility, EasyBuild for scientific software installations, and Lmod for the user interface to the software stack. The successful applicant will take a leading role in maturing the EESSI infrastructure, and integrating its use in the MultiXscale project.
